        <h3>Why accessiblity matters</h3>
        <p>Accessibility matters because 1.3 billion people worldwide, including 2 million in the Netherlands, experience significant disabilities, and over half of Dutch smartphone users rely on accessibility settings to navigate their devices.</p>

        <p>Digital Accessibility improves the experience for all users, not just those with disabilities.</p>

        <h3>Why we need a minset shift</h3>
        <p>Neglecting to prioritize accessibility not only excludes a significant portion of your audience but also means missing out on a range of advantages that can greatly enhance your digital presence. Accessible design leads to a better overall user experience for everyone, as it ensures your website is intuitive and easy to navigate.</p>
        <p>It also often results in faster loading times, as accessibility improvements typically streamline functionality and optimize performance. </p>
        <p>Additionally, websites that prioritize accessibility tend to rank higher on Google, as search engines reward sites with better usability and structure. This improved SEO translates to greater visibility, helping you reach more potential customers.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, by embracing accessibility, you not only foster inclusivity but also enjoy higher conversion rates, as more users can engage seamlessly with your content or services.</p>
